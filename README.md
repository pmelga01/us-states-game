US States Guessing Game

Author: Pamela Melgar
Date: December 29th, 2023

Description:
    A guessing game to help users better memorize the states and keep track of
    which states have been guessed so far and which ones have not. When the user
    ends the game, they are given a csv containing all the state names they 
    have yet to learn so they can continue practicing.

    Made with Python using pandas and turtle.
